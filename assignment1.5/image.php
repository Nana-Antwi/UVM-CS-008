        <p>The idea of making the world a better place can be challenging. 
            It is not only easy but understandable to think, 
            I’m only one person; what can I really do? However, 
            if every person thinks that, nothing will get done.
            But if every person did just one thing to make the world a better place today,
            billions of acts of kindness, social responsibility and generosity 
            would take place, and wouldn’t that alone change the face of this planet?
