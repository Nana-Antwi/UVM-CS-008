        <p>Global warming is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system. Since 1971, 90% of the increased energy has been stored in the oceans, mostly in the 0 to 700m region. The continually increase has shaken up the Earth and people reactions to it.
            A real problem it causes is the rise in the Earth temperature's  and the depletion of the polar ice caps which cause the mass on the ocean to be more than that of the earth's land mass. If this condition is not reduce or managed it will lead to bad effects on the earth</p>
