        <p>Natural Disasters are a major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples include floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geologic processes. A natural disaster can cause loss of life or property damage, 
            and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on the affected population's resilience, or ability to recover</p>
