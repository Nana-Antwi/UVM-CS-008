        <p>The web site I picked to discuss this week is:<a href="http://www.supremenewyork.com/">SupremeNewYork</a>

        <p>What i like about the site is the the user interface and the style of it looking more like a lookbook in a fashion store</p>


        <p>What I don't like about the site is by looking at a person with less knowledge of site will face problems</p>

        <p>Web design questions: 1. The site looks like a lookbook from the fashion store is this achieved through css or html coding? </p>

        <h1>What is the Goal of the Web Site? Short Term Goal? Long Term Goal? (primary purpose)</h1>   

        <p>The goal of the site is to advertise fashion products with long term goal of convincing to buy products online.</p>

        <h1>What results would you like to see on the web site?</h1>   
        <p>The whole interface has to change to make it easier to use.</p>

        <h1>Who is your intended audience?</h1>   
        <p>The intended audience is the urban youth</p>

        <h1>What type and level of navigation do want to provide for the web site? (home button, site map, menues on every page)</h1>   
        <p>The navigation buttons should be big and more visible</p>

        <h1>Why will people visit your site? What will they be looking for: Information, Products, Entertainment?</h1>   
        <p>The target audience visiting the site will be looking at fashions products advertised and the can also buy online.</p>

        <h1>Would you go back to this site?</h1> 
        <p>I would go back to this site because it offers a different from all similar fashion sites.</p>
