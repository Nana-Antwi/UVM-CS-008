        <p>Making The World A Better Place</p>

        <p>The world for centuries has had its fair share of problems. Thus the need to make it a better a place. 
            Issues like; Global Warming, Hunger, Political Unrest, Natural Disaster and Economic downturns cause an imbalance in our societies.
            The creation of programs like; the world program, disaster relief, peace keeping campaigns and government bail outs etc, has brought a little close in achieving our millennium development goals.
            As humans we have to be proactive and join all efforts of making the world a better place because earth is life and life is us.</p>
