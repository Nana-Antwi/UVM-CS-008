<h3> Image map of GroovyUV Concerts history </h3>

<p>The University of Vermont over a period of time has provided
    its students with concerts all geared toward improving the
    standards in community, service and education. These concerts
    are held twice every academic year in the fall season and the
    spring season. Their respective names are fall fest and spring fest.
    This platform has provided students with the best form of entertainment
    with big names in the music industry like schoolboy Q, asap rocky,
    mac miller, griz, keys n krates etc. The image below of musical notes is a little history from 2012 to 2013,
